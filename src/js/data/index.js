  bio:
    "I am a focused and ambitious Senior/Lead Front End Developer with solid experience creating sites, applications and tooling for a wide range of clients and sectors including financial, commercial, retail, automotive and advertising for global recognised companies such as BBC and Saatchi & Saatchi. I have a broad knowledge of JavaScript, am proficient in a number of modern frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, Redux) and have experience managing and mentoring front end teams.<br /><br />My passion for web development coupled with my ability to pick up new skills quickly means that I stay on top of most relevant technologies and directions. I achieve this by attending various conferences and talks around Europe and spending my free time experimenting and getting to grips with modern development trends that may not be a fit for my current projects. I'm currently most excited about functional programming patterns with tools such as Ramda and ReasonMl and modern API approaches such as GraphQl.<br /><br />Due to my previous exposure and familiarity with backend technologies I am also comfortable taking ownership of the full stack and have experience in Node, PHP, Python and Scala as well as various database languages. I also have experience in Agile, prototyping and waterfall development methodologies as well as tools like JIRA.<br /><br />In recent positions I have been given the responsibility to perform in a lead capacity, where I can help and mentor more junior developers. I have found this to be a rewarding part of my role, It has also helped to learn the technologies better through teaching.<br /><br />I also have an interest and good understanding of UX and design, and I will always try to work with designers to help them translate their ideas into usable and scalable systems.",
